## Capsaicin
<b>Capsaicin</b> (/kæpˈseɪ.ᵻsɪn/; <b>8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide</b>) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called <b>capsaicinoids</b> and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. Pure capsaicin is a volatile, hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, crystalline to waxy compound.
